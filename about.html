        <p>The Mushroom Foundation is a mushroom-community-centered foundation. Our purpose is to become the bridge between mushroom communities and human being. In recent years, we became one of the most popular bio-design materials in human world (finally not the most popular ingredient in plant-based dishes). We are more than happy to support and help human to improve their life style. We are also, more than happy to share our community based knowledge with human society.</p>
        <p>Known as a democratic community, we are famous for our 'talking network.' Our sister community-- forest is holding one of the most crucial position in this 'free talk' network, for survival, for communication, and for chitchat. The Mother Tree is what we communicate with forest members and other community; we are eagar to find a 'Mother Tree' between us and human.</p>
